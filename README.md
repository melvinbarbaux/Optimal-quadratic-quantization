1st year Master MIGS thesis

Quantization of a continuous probability law by a discrete law in the Gaussian case
The aim of this thesis was to understand the notion of quantization and to use algorithms to find the best discrete probability distributions 
that approximate continuous distributions. We concentrated mainly on the framework of Gaussian laws and Gaussian vectors.
To understand the theory behind the algorithms, you can read the pdf which is the dissertation we handed in in May 2023 as part of our master 1.
